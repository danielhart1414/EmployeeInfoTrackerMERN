# EmployeeInfoTrackerMERN

This app (named "EmployeeData" in-app) allows you to type in basic employee information and store it in a database. The entries currently present in the database appear in a table at the top of the page. You can select one or more entries to delete, and you can update entries one at a time.

This is the MERN version of my Angular/ASP.NET Core app EmployeeInfoTracker.
