# EmployeeInfoTrackerMERN

This app (named "EmployeeData" in-app) allows you to store basic employee information in a Mongo database. The entries present in the database appear in a table at the top of the Tracker page. You can select any table entry to delete or edit it.

To get the app running, you'll need a string called ATLAS_CONNECTION_STRING in a .env file on the backend. This must be a valid MongoDB Atlas connection string. You'll also need to have Node.js version 14 or higher installed.

This is the MERN version of my Angular/ASP.NET Core app EmployeeInfoTracker.
